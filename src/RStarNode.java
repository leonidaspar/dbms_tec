    * RStarNode.java,
    The root node is at the top.
    Each non leaf node has multiple children,
    Every child is a node, and the parent keeps a  box that encloses all points in that child.
    At the leaf level, the children are data records, not further nodes.
    each nodes stores:
       A list of bounding boxes -> to mbr
       A list of child pointers -> shows that the child node of it is located at this (x) point

    for the boolean isLeaf:(gpt auto den xero an eine etsi na ginei 
                if yes -->   A leaf node has MBRs that enclose single data points (or small groups) and pointers that reference those data records in datafile.dat.
                if no  -->  An internal node has MBRs that enclose entire subtrees, and pointers that reference other R*-tree nodes in indexfile.dat.
